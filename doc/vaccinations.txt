Vaccination Support in OCEMR
============================

Overview
--------

  It is important to track vaccinations for our patients.  The actual
implementation can be done in multiple ways.  On the backend, I could
piggy back the vaccination support off of the currently implemented
medication support or vaccinations could be a totally seperate set of
data points with all new user interface views.

Extending Medication to support Vaccinations
--------------------------------------------

  Vaccinations are a specific sub-type of medications.  This possible
implementation would extend the idea of medication being tied to a
diagnosis by allowing a medication to be tied to a diagnosis or a
vaccination.

 * Pros
   * may make the user interface more streamlined.

 * Cons
   * Introduces more complexity into the codebase surrounding meds

Tracking Vaccinations Seperately
--------------------------------

  Vaccinations are seperate set of data tables and user views in the
system. while they may not need a seperate "queue" view, they would
appear a seperate lists on the med queue.

 * Pros
   * seperation between meds and vaccines will limit the possibility
   of introducing bugs into the codebase surrounding the complex
   medication process.
   * seperation of meds and vacs will preserve the expected functionality
   of existing reporting functionality
 * Cons
   * adding a seperate section to the medqueue for vaccinations may
   complicate the user's checkout process.

Logical Structure of Vaccinations
---------------------------------


* VacType	= This tracks a specific vaccination by what it treats.
  * Ex. "Measles", "Hep-A", "Typhoid"
  * Should contain the fields ( "title", ... )
* Vac		+ This field would track vaccinations for patients
  * Fields - Patient, VacType, Date, Batchnumber?, Num in Series?, ... ?
* VacNote	= similar to Med Notes or LabNotes, etc....

Open Questions
--------------

  @ Engeye, what is the process currently for tracking and administering
vaccines?

  Are vaccines handled like any other medication? i.e. perscribed by the
nurse/doctor, then given in the pharmacy?

  How does this process work generally at other facilities?
