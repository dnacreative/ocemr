User Change Summary v0.4.X -> v0.5.0
====================================

* Bugs Fixed - since 0.4.1.2 *
------------------------------

  * Duplicate Diagnosis records added  when multiple users "claim" the
	same visit.
  * Addressed printing issues where long lines would get cutoff in
	patient's printed record.
  * The Daily Patient report in December was not tracking patient number
	per month correctly.
  * The Date printed out on a patient record is now taken from when the
	visit is marked finished, not when it was scheduled.


* New Vitals - Pulse Oxymetry and Oxygen *
------------------------------------------

  Two new vital statistics were added to the system, %spO2 and %oxygen. %spO2
measure the patient's pulse oxymetry and %oxygen measure how much oxygen (if
any) the patient is on. Use percentages -- real numbers are supported (as
opposed to only integers) -- %oxygen should be Zero unless patient is on
extra oxygen.


* New Patient Fields *
----------------------
  Added two text fields to Patient table, labeled alternate contact. You can
find them on the New Patient pop-up and the patient details page.


* Cost Estimation *
-------------------
  Each MedType and LabType will now have a base cost in the database. In the
checkout process, after the meds have been marked dispensed, the MedQueue
will display a cost estimate. The cost estimate is calculated as follows.

	Completed Labs * Each Lab Type's cost
	+ Dispensed Meds * Each Med Type's cost * dispense amount.

  So, in order for this feature to work, You'll need to come up with an
appropriate cost for each lab and each med type.


* Vaccination Tracking *
------------------------
  Vaccination tracking is added as a separate function in a patient's chart.
The purpose is to track when and what vaccinations a patient has received.
Adding records to this page does not order any medication.


* Staff User Changes *
----------------------

  * Admin

  The previously labeled "Admin" link from the main menu has been moved
to a sub-menu on the "User Preferences" page. User administrative tasks
will now be available there under the heading "Staff Functions." The link
has been renamed to "Data Admin Panel."
  
  * Merge Village Wizard

  This is a new utility to correct misspellings of Villages. Click here, select the incorrect village in the first box, the correct in the second, and hit
"submit!"

  * Backup the Database

  This automates the database backup functionality and makes it available
to staff users. Clicking this link will generate a new backup and provide it
for download right through the web interface!
  *NOTE*: This actually does the backup in real time on the server. Using this
function may impact performance of a running system, use with caution.
