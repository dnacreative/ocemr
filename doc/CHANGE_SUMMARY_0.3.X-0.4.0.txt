User Interface Change Summary v0.3.4 -> v0.4.0
==============================================

* Localization Support *
------------------------

  The software now automatically detects your prefered languages and formats
dates according to your locale. This means that if you have your language set
to American English, dates will display as Month-Date-Year; if you have your
language set to British English, dates will display as Date-Month-Year.

  You can change the detected default in the new 'User Prefs' page and the
system will save the setting for your user in the future.

* Patient Queue and Info *
--------------------------

  You will no longer see the 'Scheduled Visits' section on the Patient Queue
page, the system will automatically mark scheduled visits as missed after a
few days. When you are checking someone in just search for them by name and
if they have a scheduled visit you can mark them as 'Seen' in the scheduled
visits section of their 'Patient Info' page.

  Also, I've added a couple of options to the Patient Info Page. Firstly,
you can now edit the gender of a patient in case of mistake. Secondly, you
can add a contact phone number or email address to their record if it's
available.

- Patient Charts -
------------------

  I redesigned the past visits page to hopefully make it clearer and easier
to read. Allergies that are added to a patient show up in red at the top of
their chart.

* Vitals, Adding and Viewing *
------------------------------

  When adding vitals, the system now shows you all possible types at once. In
addition, heights, weights, and temperatures require you to include a unit in
the submission and automatically convert it on the backend. All of the fields
on the 'Add Vitals' form are optional, so include only the measurments you
want to record.

  The system will display the patients vitals linked by their submission date
and will also alow you to view their vitals in a series of historical graphs.

- System Administration and Reporting -
---------------------------------------

  Users with access to the 'Admin' section of the site should now see a link
available from the main menu, making it easier to navigate there for
administrative tasks.

  Tally type reports can now generate a pie chart, csv file, or just display
the results directly in a table. Added 3 new reports: the Lab, Med, and
Clinician tally reports.
