OCEMR - Open Clinic Electronic Medical Records 
==============================================

Summary
-------

  OCEMR is a web based electronic medical records system designed for the
clinic environment. It is currently in use in the Engeye Health Clinic located
in Ddegeya, Uganda (near Masaka, UG.) When looking into setting up an EMR for
this donation based clinic, all the open-source solutions seemed too heavily
feature-laden to really work for our situation, so, we built our own. Designed
for small clinics in rural parts of the world, this web-based EMR is light and
fast.
